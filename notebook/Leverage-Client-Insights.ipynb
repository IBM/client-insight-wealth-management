We'll look at various common advisor activities such as:\n* preparing to defend the relationship from a potential request to leave for another advisor\n* preparing products and recommendations ahead of a meeting by gaining insights into the client's recent or impending life changes \n* identifying cross-sell and up-sell opportunities by reviewing existing product ownership and service provision / subscription augmented by leads from the analytics\n* benchmarking the client, enabling the provision of typical actions, events and holdings of \"similar\" clients by identifying the customer's segment \n\nThis information can also assist an advisor in preparing for the meeting by identifying potential new requirements or changes to existing requirements, and by providing a more personal touch through more detailed knowledge of recent events in the client's life or financial status.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Contents\n* <a href=\"#env\">Set-up the environment</a>\n* <a href=\"#profile\">Retrieve the complete client profile</a>\n* <a href=\"#basic\">Understand basic client information</a>\n* <a href=\"#leave\">Retain clients - propensity for attrition</a>\n* <a href=\"#product\">Assess needs by product</a>\n* <a href=\"#life\">Identify upcoming life events</a>\n* <a href=\"#segment\">Segment clients</a>\n* <a href=\"#why\">Determine underlying reasons</a>\n* <a href=\"#trend\">Gain perspective</a>", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<a id='env'></a>\n### Set-up the environment\n\nLoad key modules that we'll use to keep track of time and interact with the REST API, specify the API_KEY for the service and set key parameters.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import requests\nimport time\nimport json\nfrom pandas.io.json import json_normalize\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pygments import highlight\nfrom pygments.lexers import JsonLexer\nfrom pygments.formatters import TerminalFormatter, TerminalTrueColorFormatter\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\napi_key = \"41e75df9-0d8f-4063-bf72-facad8d1fd7a\"\n\nhost = \"ci-api.mybluemix.net\"\nbasePath = \"/api/v2/wealth/\"\nbase_url = \"https://\" + host + basePath #  the path to the Client Insights for Wealth Management service on IBM Cloud\n\napi_context = \"application/json\" #  the type of information we're passing to the API\nhead = {\"Authorization\" : api_key, \n        \"Content-Type\" : api_context} # the headers we're using with the API to provide context and authorization\n\neffective_date = \"2018-09-30\" # the date used to get records with the most recent date\npage_size = 500", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "customer_id = 1489\n#customer_id = 1285\n#customer_id = 1015\n#customer_id = 1725\n#customer_id = 1880", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "**Note**: Please feel free to try any of the above customer_ids to see different results.

Generally, the application used by the advisor, be that some form of Advisor Desktop or CRM, would receive a more complete history and personal information, including the client\u2019s actual name and identity from the financial institution\u2019s own systems.
